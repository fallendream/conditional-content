Conditional Content Plugin
============

This plugin allows your Wordpress installation to display different content, based on a variable you append to the URLs. Usually this content is included in a predestined widget place in your theme.

When to use it?
------------

If you want to make campaigns and maybe add a http://example.com/?ref=XYZ tag to your URL then with this plugin you can display content based on the ref tag. E.g. replace a header image.

How to use it?
-------------

1. Install the plugin code into `/wp-content/plugins` directory of your Wordpress installation.
2. Activate the plugin.
3. Insert the plugin in the plugin slot where you want the content to be displayed. Since this can be a prominent/very special spot you might have to edit your theme.
4. In the widget configuration, choose a ref variable name and the page name which should be displayed when the variable is appended to the URL. The page name must be found by looking up the ID or the name of the page.
